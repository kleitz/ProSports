ProSports is an extendable all-in-one sports data plugin that helps sports clubs set up and manage a league or club site quickly and easily.

== Description ==
= Create a Professional Sports Website =
Transform your WordPress blog into a fully configurable team, club, or league website. Features a suite of sports tools including fixtures, results, automated standings, players rankings, and individual profiles for clubs, players, and staff.

== Installation ==
= Minimum Requirements =
* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic Installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of ProSports, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “ProSports” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our sports plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking Install Now. After clicking that link you will be asked if you’re sure you want to install the plugin. Click yes and WordPress will automatically complete the installation.

= Manual Installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our sports plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application.

1. Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it
2. Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel, upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation’s wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu within the WordPress admin.

= Upgrading =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the event/team/player/staff pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting \'save\'. That should return things to normal.

== Screenshots ==

1. Select your sport to automatically install presets and sample data.
2. Each team has a unique logo and website URL. Optionally link teams from your blog to their official websites.
3. The overview page provides a birds-eye view of your entire sports network.
4. Configure variables used throughout the plugin to fit your sport. Presets are provided for some sports, and will automatically populate these options.
5. Design your own points system using the custom drag-and-drop equation builder.
6. Twenty Fourteen theme showcasing the dynamic league table and some of the included widgets.
